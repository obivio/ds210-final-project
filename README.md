# Obioma Eke DS 210 Final Project

My complete writeup is a pdf that is located in this repository. In this project, I analyzed an Amazon product co-purchasing network dataset using a Breadth First Search Algorithm and created a visualization. I think the simplest way to start is to clone this repository by using git clone in the terminal with the web url. More details are included in my writeup!
